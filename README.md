# Breeze

## Project Overview
Breeze is an interactive, real-time web application. It provides users with a unique way to explore and engage with their campus community.

## Key Features
- **Got to think about this. But still going to be awesome.**

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: ReactJS
- Backend: Socket.io and ExpressJS
- Map Rendering: Custom pixel art, some ui library(tailwind probably...)

## Hackathon Information
- Event: DevJams'24
- Date: 20 sept - 22 sept 2024
- Team: sapphire

## Challenges:
- The biggest design challenge was making the entire campus map into pixel art.
- AI tools weren't able to help, and we were not about to change the idea!
- Hence, we decided to recreate a small area of the campus instead of the entirety. 
- The next design challenge was assets. Designing everything by hand was taking too much time, so we decided to use some freely available assets.
- And we pivot....

- its a web application now.
